This implies that the YMCs must have gone through at least one full crossing time before their presently observed age. Using the crossing time equation, $t_{cross}=(GMr_{vir}^{-3})^{-1/2}$ and fixing the crossing time to 1 Myr we can solve for $t$, which is only dependent on the mass. \cite{Arce_1999}//
