For the same clump mass range mentioned for \textit{r_{$\Omega$}} above, \textit{r_{vir}} spans from 5.1 to 23.8 pc. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as there is no evidence for YMCs to have a proportionality between mass and radius. (Bedini 2013)

$∫\eta=\frac{\pi^{1/2}m^{1/2}_{e}Ze^{2}c^{2}}{\gamma_{E}8(2\kappa_{B}T)^{3/2}} lnΛ\approx7×10^{11}       (1)$
